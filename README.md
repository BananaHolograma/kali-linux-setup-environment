This is my initial configuration I apply on all my ArchLinux installations, it contains a minimal setup to start being productive in no time.

# Requirements

This configuration is based on gnome desktop environment because I set up some custom keyboard layouts by using the package `gnome-tweaks`. So make sure you have installed the gnome desktop environment before start the script to get the best of it.
In case you don't have it yet on your ArchLinux just install them and reboot the system:

```bash
pacman -S gnome gnome-tweaks

systemctl enable gdm # gnome display manager
# or
systemctl enable gdm.service
```

# Configuration

The `config` folder contains all the related configurations that are important for the script because it takes this files and move them to the
new system in the correct way.

## Fonts ✍️

This folder contains all the external fonts, the default used is HackNerdFonts from [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to beautify the zsh terminal experience along with kitty.

## Kitty Terminal 🐱

The [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) terminal is the next-gen cross platform shell designed for enjoyment in use, I defined a smooth configuration to start working with it and enjoy the potential gives us.

## Vim 👨🏽‍💻

I took the basic configuration file from the repository [https://github.com/amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) with few changes from my part.

## Vscode settings 🆚

This only contains the `settings.json` for my daily worklow and I decided to be optional because some times I don't install vscode

## ZSH 🖥️

The minimalist setup for zsh with plugins that works for me and I use everyday. I only use the initial powerlevel10k assistant with my `.zshrc` modified and adapted for new installations.

# Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/s3r0s4pi3ns/archlinux-post-install-setup.git
# Run the script
cd archlinux-post-install-setup && bash install.sh
```
